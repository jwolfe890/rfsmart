<h1>Why am I a great fit for RF-Smart?</h1>
    <ul class="top container2">
        <li><b>Crazy for our customers:</b> I have a deep appreciation for customer satisfaction and don’t believe a project is finished until it exceeds expectations.</li>
        <li><b>Easy to do business with:</b> Project management is something I have significant experience with, and I recognize that a critical part of satisfying customers is identifying problems early in the process and working clearly and directly with them to achieve optimal solutions.</li>
        <li><b>We have your back:</b> Subsequently, I have developed an intuitive sense of what needs to be done for customer care and can act on this knowledge and experience with speed and efficiency for project success.</li>
        <li><b>We take fun seriously:</b> I’m a work-focused perfectionist, but I know how to have fun and relax.</li>
        <li><b>Creativity matters:</b> As an individual with a humanities background, creative thinking and problem-solving are an integral part of my thought process; yet, I still recognize the importance of having an objective and analytical mindset.</li>
        <li><b>Striving to earn and keep trust: </b>Trust is earned through honesty and integrity, and in all my relationships with others I work to establish this foundation and make sacrifices when necessary to maintain it.</li>
        <li><b>We are compassionate:</b> I cultivate empathy and sympathy for others. I’ve experienced enough life to know that even the smartest people make mistakes, and that circumstances change.</li>
        <li><b>Ever-expanding impact:</b> Learning new things is as essential to my life as food and water. Working in and helping cultivate a community of shared knowledge is natural to my personality. My ever-expanding impact would be felt through teamwork and personal initiative.</li>
    </ul>
